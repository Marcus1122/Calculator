# Calculator
## Project Description

![Calc!](http://i.imgur.com/1K8mRIZ.png)

Your goal is to develop a calculator app in Java 8 with a graphical user interface
(GUI) powered by JavaFX. You will be responsible for designing and implementing
the user interface for your project (following a few guidelines). This
calculator app is interesting in that we will provide two different
implementations for handling mathematical operations: an iterative
implementation (loops) and a recursive implementation. This will be accomplished by
implementing the <code>Math</code> interface in two classes,
<code>IterativeMath</code> and <code>RecursiveMath</code>.
